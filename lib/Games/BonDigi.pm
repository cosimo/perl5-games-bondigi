=head1 NAME

Games::BonDigi

=head1 ABSTRACT

This is a crazy experiment in game algorithms and list iterators.
And the algorithm to generate BonDigi sequences is quite interesting...

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Games::BonDigi;

    my $iter = Games::BonDigi->sequence();

    while(my $word = $iter->())
    {
        print $word, '!', "\n";
        # Wait for other players...
        sleep(1);
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, *crazy* module.
There is absolutely *no* reason to download it.
Please, stay away from it, by any means!

Ok, I've warned you.

If you don't know what Bon-Digi is, you are really lucky.

Actually, this is a quite interesting experiment in
software design of clever algorithms. Either I'm stupid
or generating the sequence of "Bon" "Digi" words is
really much harder than I thought at first.

Try to think of an algorithm and to build *elegant* and
*concise* code. You will find that is not so easy...

For any meaning of elegant and concise, of course.

=head1 DEDICATION

Esteban, I promised to do that... And there it is!

=head1 THE GAME ITSELF

  This is (did I say it?) rather crazy. I will describe it as an
  RFC and then give you an example.

  BonDigi works with its own internal protocol. The protocol
  consists of a HEADER ("fixed part"), and a PAYLOAD ("the part
  that grows").

  HEADER is *always*: "Bon", "Digi", "Bon", "Digi"

  PAYLOAD is "Bon", "Bon", "Digi", "Digi" (2 repeats the first
  time, then it grows with 3, 4, 5, you get it)

=head1 FULL GRAMMAR

  <PROTOCOL> := "" | <HEADER> <PAYLOAD> <PROTOCOL>

  <HEADER>   := "Bon" "Digi" "Bon" "Digi"

  <PAYLOAD>  := "Bon" (<n> times) "Digi" (<n> times)
                where <n> grows over time

Mmmh, a recursive stateful grammar. Gets hard.
Ok, just kidding...

=head1 EXAMPLE

Suppose you are ten people in the same room, drinking beers
or something. Then someone starts this *crazy* game.

At turn, each of you must say the next word in the sequence.
If you say the wrong word, you must drink beer, write
Games::BonDigi, make yourself foolish, and so on...

Sequence starts like this:

    Bon, Digi, Bon, Digi, /*header*/, Bon, Bon, Digi, Digi, /*payload x 2*/,
    Bon, Digi, Bon, Digi, /*header*/, Bon, Bon, Bon, Digi, Digi, Digi, /*payload x 3*/
    ...

and you got it.
Right?

=head1 SEE ALSO

I didn't find any serious information about this game on the
internet. If you find it, please tell me about.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<new()>

Just a class constructor, useless anyway.
If you want to use it, please do. Otherwise, you can use class name.

=item C<sequence( [$start [,$end [,@words]]] )>

Returns an iterator that generates the BonDigi(tm) sequence of words.
Without any parameters, the iterator will return words forever, in an 
endless crazy sequence of BonDigi words.

Parameters are:

=over

=item C<$start>

Start of repeats sequence. Default is 2. Means that the payload
starts by repeating each word C<$start> times.

=item C<$end>

End of repeats sequence. Just puts a cruel end to insane fun. Why?
By default, there's no end. If you set C<$end>, iterator will stop
exactly when the payload reaches C<$end> length in repeats.

=item C<@words>

If you supply your own words, the game won't really be B<BonDigi> anymore.
I warned you. Don't do evil.
